Euler 20: Square Remainders
===================================

This project aims to solve the Euler 20 problem (https://projecteuler.net/problem=20). The goal is to calulate the sum of the digits of factorial of 100

Project Structure
-----------------

- `euler-20-Factorial-Digit-Sum.go` - The Go source code for solving the problem.
- `runner.sh` - The shell script to compile and run the program with the two provided values.
- `task-description.ascii` - The asciidoc formatted task description for the Euler 120 problem.
- `stdout.txt` - An example output file containing the expected output from the program.
- `suppress-io.txt` - Hide the output in the Einstein report this ensures that students cannot hardwire the test cases into their solution.

Building and Running the Project
--------------------------------

1. Make sure the runner.sh script is executable:

2. Run the runner.sh script to execute the script with two values as input:

Expected Output
---------------

After running the program, the expected output for each cycle should be:
