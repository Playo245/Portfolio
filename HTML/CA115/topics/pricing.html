        <h2>How is it free</h2>
        <p>Our app is completely free to download and use.  We are able to provide this service for free because we will have in-app advertising. The advertising in the app will provide as our main revenue stream.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p> We wanted to make sure that making our app 100% free would be the best decision for our business. Through extensive research we found that providing our app for free would not only benefit our users but also our business. Some of the many pros of providing a free app is that it attracts users and grows the user base. It also allows us to collect more data on our users and provide highly personalised and engaging advertisement.  </p>
