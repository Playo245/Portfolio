    <h1>Product Description</h1>
    <p>Our product is a navigation app called Irish Maps. It is based on the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland only. Whatâ€™s unique about this product is you can draw your own route to your destination. Instead of following the Global Positioning System (GPS), you can lead. Our app can show you the bus timetables and the entire route they take. This is helpful for people who take the bus.</p>

        <h2>What is our app</h2>
        <p>Our app will show cycle tracks that are friendly towards cyclists. We will include the price of bus tickets, tolls in motorways and the Dublin City bikes. We will also include a status on each route you choose, to show how much traffic there is. There'll be tourist suggestions on our map. We will aim to provide an estimated cost for each mode of transport to give the user options of which is cost-effective.</p>

        <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <p>The main difference between us and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@53.3886301,-6.2630583,14z">Google Maps</a> is that we will give updates to warn drivers, cyclists, motor cyclists and pedestrians about crashes or roadworks so that they can change routes. Because we look after Ireland, we will be more accurate than Google Maps with our GPS. We also aim to update the traffic status constantly. This will ensure that users can be up to date with the traffic so they can change their routes.</p>
