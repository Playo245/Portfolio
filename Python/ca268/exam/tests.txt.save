Tree runtime = O(dp + 1) for depth
Traversal algorithm requires time O(cp + 1)

A more sophisticated compression function, which helps eliminate
repeated patterns in a set of integer keys, is the
Multiply-Add-and-Divide (or “MAD”) method. This method maps an
integer i to:

MAD = [(ai + b) mod p] mod N

where N is the size of the bucket array, p is a prime number larger than
N, and a and b are integers chosen at random from the interval
[0, p − 1], with a > 0. This compression function is chosen in order to
eliminate repeated patterns in the set of hash codes and get us closer
to having a “good” hash function, that is, one such that the probability
any two different keys collide is 1/N.
