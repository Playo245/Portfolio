Lab-Recursion

Q1. Write a function sum_q1() that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of 0...n using recursion.

sum_q1(6) ➞ 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21


Q2. Using recursion, write a script to reverse an integer.

Example input-output: 123 ➞ 321


Q3. Similar to Q2, write a script to reverse a string using recursion.

Example input-output: hello ➞ olleh


Q4. Write a script to inverse a list of numbers using recursion.

Example input-output: [1, 2, 3, 4] ➞ [4, 3, 2, 1]


Q5. Create a function that returns the product of two integers. This process of multiplication can be achieved via repetitive addition, thus, the process can be done recursively. 

multiply(10, 2) ➞ 20
multiply(-51, -4) ➞ 204
multiply(3, 9) ➞ 27


Q6. A pronic number (or otherwise called as heteromecic) is a number which is a product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number of the form n(n + 1). Create a function that determines whether a number is pronic or not.

is_heteromecic(110) ➞ True
# 10 * (10 + 1) = 10 * 11 = 110


Q7. Write a function that returns the length of a string. Make your function recursive.
