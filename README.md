# Portfolio
My programming portfolio is like a scrapbook of things I did. I made cool stuff using different languages like Python, Java, C and many more. You can click around to see the programs I created. It's not just to show off, but a memory of what i learned about or still working on. My portfolio is like a diary of my programming adventures!
